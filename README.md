Just a sample project to create a Spring project on VSCode.

## Build Java
1. On the left panel of VSCode, go to Maven. Find your project, right click, `install`.

    If install successful, you will see your .jar file in the target folder.
    
    Note: Make sure you are using the the right java version.
    
    You can check in .zshrc, my java path is `export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-16.jdk/Contents/Home"`
